# Spot capacity and cost optimizer

- Bids for spot/preemptible capacity per region with fallback to on-demand nodes when volatility rises.
- Predicts eviction risk using historical data and transparently drains workloads before interruption notices.
- Generates cost reports per project and enforces budget ceilings with automated throttling.
