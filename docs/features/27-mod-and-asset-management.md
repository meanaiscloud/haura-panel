# Mod and asset management

- Curated mod catalogs with compatibility scoring, dependency resolution, and rollback support.
- Delta-based asset syncing to reduce patch times for large modpacks or texture updates.
- Sandbox testing of mods in ephemeral environments before promotion to production servers.
