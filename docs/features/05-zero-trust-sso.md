# Zero-trust SSO and RBAC

- SSO with OIDC/SAML providers plus per-action MFA challenges and device posture checks.
- Fine-grained RBAC for panels, API, CLI, and wings operations with time-bound access grants.
- Just-in-time provisioning/deprovisioning synced from identity providers with audit enforcement.
