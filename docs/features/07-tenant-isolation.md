# Tenant isolation and quotas

- Hard multi-tenancy with dedicated namespaces, per-tenant network segments, and optional bare-metal pinning.
- CPU, memory, GPU, and storage quotas with burst credits and throttling policies.
- Tenant-scoped logging, metrics, and access controls to prevent cross-project data leakage.
